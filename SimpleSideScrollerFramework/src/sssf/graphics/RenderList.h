	RenderList.h

	This class stores the data for rendering a list of
	textures each frame. While the game is running, each
	frame, lists of RenderItems may be generated for all
	visible textures. That list is then traversed and
	used for rendering and then destroyed.

	RenderItems should be placed into the list in the
	order with which they should be rendered, background
	items at the start of the list and foreground items
	at the end of the list. Rendering should be done in 
	the order of game world	and then game gui. 

	RenderItems have z values, so optionally we could
	sort the items in the list before rendering in order
	to ensure correct back to front rendering.

	Each RenderItem also has an alpha value such that each
	item can have its own custom transparency.
	
	The game world should be rendered in order of the
	game background and then game objects and characters.
	The game gui should be rendered in order of the gui
	overlay images, then gui buttons, and then the cursor.

	RenderItem - This structure represents one texture to be rendered

	of sorting via z value.
